## Butters message filter extension with sender whitelist

Spam SMSs from alphabetical numbers are a big nuisance in India. Every government department or private company keeps sending SMS from the moment they get your number. Luckily all that crap is from alphabetical senders (like AX-PEPFRY).

Butters app provides a message filter extension that can help in dealing with this problem. If enabled, all messages from alphabetical senders are marked as spam unless the sender contains any string added to whitelist.

I don't have enough money to publish this app on app store. Feel free to build and install on your iphone.
